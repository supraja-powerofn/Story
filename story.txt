Hi, readers!

Timmie Willie is a country mouse who is accidentally transported to a city in a vegetable basket.
When he wakes up, he finds himself in a party where there was a big event going.

That's when the hare and tortoise were having a race between them. 

The hare got a head-start but became overconfident towards the end of the race. His ego made him believe that he could win the race even if he rested for a while.

Timmie Willie, being a small mouse, felt that he was so similar with that tortoise and makes him a friend.
When he is unable to bear the city life, he returns to his home but invites his friend to the village.
When his friend visits him, something similar happens.

It doesn't matter where we are, how we are matters!
