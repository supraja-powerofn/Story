Hi, readers!

Timmie Willie is a country mouse who is accidentally transported to a city in a vegetable basket.
When he wakes up, he finds himself in a party and makes a friend.
When he is unable to bear the city life, he returns to his home but invites his friend to the village.
When his friend visits him, something similar happens.

Humans have been living without cities or villages for most of history.
That means that both village and city life are recent inventions.
And just like every other invention, we need to decide their costs and benefits.
